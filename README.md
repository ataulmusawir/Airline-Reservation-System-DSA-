# Airline-Reservation-System-DSA-
The GIKI Airline Reservation System is a flight management program that simulates an airline's reservation process. It uses data structures like linked lists, hash tables, queues, and priority queues, along with algorithms like Dijkstraâ€™s and BFS, to handle flight scheduling, route finding, and passenger reservations efficiently.
